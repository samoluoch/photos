This is an application that showcases my pictures taken in different locations and posted in different categories.

### Developed By
Samuel Oluoch Mukoya

### Description
In the app, users can view all the images that I post. During the viewing when on the home page, users will see all photos posted in different categories and that were taken in different locations. To avoid users checking all images yet they may be interested in viewing images in a particular category or location. Therefore, they can search images by typing either a category or location that is available and all images related to the search term will be rendered to them. Additionally, when a user clicks on an image in the home page, the image enlarges and the image details such as location, name, category, etc are rendered to the user.


### Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Load the app on any web browser such as Chrome, Mozilla, or Internet Explorer.
2. Images will then load.
3. Click on your preferred image and its details will pop up for you to view.
4. To search image by category or location, just type the category name such as Party, or location name such as Nairobi, in the search tab and click on search.
5. To edit the code, just clone the whole folder and open the files using any text editors



### Known Bugs
There are currently no known bugs for the app. However, I will be updating the README incase any bugs arise.
